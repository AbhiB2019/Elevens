1.  5-6
2. Yes becuase all cards have a match and if there are only 3 cards left they all have to match each other and be taken our in one move so they have to be the face cards.
3. There is no strategy because the order you do things in doesnt matter because there is only one pair for every card so you end up in the same spot no matter what you do.
